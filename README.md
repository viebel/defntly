# defntly

A library that makes the creation of `defn` like macros in Clojure/Script a commodity.

# The problem it addresses

Quite often in an mid size application, we need to apply some patterns to functions. 

A pattern could be wrapping the body of a function in a `try/catch` or adding some instrumentation on this function.

One way to wrap the body of a function `f` is to create a high order function that wraps it. The code would probably looks like this:

```clj

(defn wrapper [f]
  (fn [& args]
     (try 
      (apply f args)
      (catch Throwable e
        (throw (Exception. (str "Exception caught in function " name ": " e))))
        
(defn foo [a b]
  (+ a b))

(def foo-wrapped (wrapper foo))
```

The major problem with this approach is that the code for `foo-wrapped` is distant from its effective body.

An attempt to solve this problem is to write `foo` as an anonymous function.

```clj
(defn foo [a b]
  (+ a b))

(def foo-wrapped (wrapper (fn [a b]
                             (+ a b))))
```


But then the expression that defines `foo-wrapped` is a `def` form which is a bit weird.

`defntly` addresses this issue by making it super easy to write a `defn` like macro.

For instance, with `defntly` you could create a `defn-try` macro and uses it exactly like `defn`:

```clj
(defn-try foo [a b]
    (+ a b))
```

Writing a `defn-try` macro is not an easy task if you want to support all the various ways to use `defn`: docstring, metadata, multi-arity...

With `defntly`, writing a `defn` like macro it becomes a commodity!

# Usage

Leiningen/Boot: `[viebel/defntly "0.0.1"]`

Clojure CLI/deps.edn: `viebel/defntly {:mvn/version "0.0.1"}`

```clj
(require '[defntly.core :refer [defn-update-body]])
```

# Examples

Let's create a `defn-try` macro that automatically wraps the function body in a `try/catch` form.

```clj
(require '[defntly.core :refer [defn-update-body]])

(defn wrap-try [name body]
  `((try ~@body
    (catch Throwable ~'e
      (throw (Exception. (str \"Exception caught in function \" ~name \": \" ~'e)))))))

(defmacro defn-try [& args]
  (defn-update-body wrap-try args))
```

We use `defn-try` exactly like `defn`:

```clj
(defn-try foo [a b]
    (+ a b))
```

is macroexpanded into:

```clj
 (defn foo [a b]
  (try
    (+ a b)
    (catch
      java.lang.Throwable
      e
      (throw (str "Exception caught in function " "foo" ": " e)))))
```

We can pass to our freshly created `defn-try` macro all the args that `defn` receive (metadata, docstring, multi arity).

For instance, a mutli arity function with a docstring like:

```clj
(defn-try foo
    "foo has a docstring"
    ([a] (foo a 42))
    ([a b] (+ a b)))
```

is macroexpanded into:

```clj
(defn foo
  "foo has a docstring"
  ([a]
    (try
      (foo a 42)
      (catch
        java.lang.Throwable
        e
        (throw (str "Exception caught in function " "foo" ": " e)))))
  ([a b]
    (try
      (+ a b)
      (catch
        java.lang.Throwable
        e
        (throw (str "Exception caught in function " "foo" ": " e))))))
```
